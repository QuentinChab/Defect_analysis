This set of functions allow to extract from an image
- the vector field
- the position, charge and orientation of topological defects
- the splay-bend anisotropy e=(k1-k3)/(k1+k3) associated to each defect
- includes a little interface to tune the detection parameter, see the example.

Take a look at the example (Example.ipy)!
(And please be patient with the sliders, computations can take a few seconds)


Now we describe:
1. Required Packages
2. Desciption of the main function, inputs and outputs
3. Desciption of the interface functions


////Required Packages////

- Standard Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy -> no installation required)
- trackpy
- scikit image (version >=0.18)

Install running on a python or anaconda prompt (a good practice is to create a dedicated conda environnement)
> conda install -c conda-forge trackpy
or
> pip install trackpy

and
> conda install scikit-image
or
> pip install -U scikit-image


////Description////

The main function to call is defect_analyzer in the script chained_defects.
It takes an image and detection parameters, compute the vector field, find the defects and compute their anisotropy.
It displays an interface that allows to check and modify the parameters before validating the whole computation.
It is called by typing:
>from chained_defects import defect_analyzer
>defect_tab, f_out, R_out, order_out = defect_analyzer(imgpath, f_in, R_in, stack=True)


INPUTS
imgpath: path to the image to analyze
f_in: typical size (in px) of a characteristic feature for orientation field computation. The vector field is computed on a window of sigma=1.5*f_in. For a cell monolayer this can be the width.
R_in: Radius of the contour on which the anisotropy is computed. In this region, the orientation field should only be distorted by the defect.
stack: boolean. Is the image a stack?

OUTPUTS
defect_tab: pandas dataframe with characteristics of the defects (charge, position, axis, anisotropy,...)
f_out: Size of characteristic feature chosen through interface
R_out: Size of contour radius chosen through interface
order_out: Threshold of order parameter for the detectino of defects

////Interface functions////
SLIDERS
Radius of detection [px]: update the radius of detection in pixel. This adjusts the value of anisotropy.
Feature size [px]: update the size of the characteristic feature in pixel. This adjusts the vector field and detectino of defects (position and orientation)
Threshold: Threshold of the nematic order_parameter for the detection of defect. If a region has an order smaller than the threshold, there is a defect. 

BUTTONS
R-detection: Show/Hide around the defects the radius of contour.
Director: Show/Hide the computed director field.
Reset: Reset the slider values to their original values.
OK: Accept these parameter values. The figure is closed and the chosen values returned.
Save Image: Saves the current display on a chosen folder.
