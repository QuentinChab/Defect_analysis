Description of all the files in alphabetical order

////ref_epsilon////
contains reference angular profiles (director field as a function of azimuthal angle) for a +1/2 topological defect, for many values or anisotropy. 
For performance, it is better to have them stored.

////20240215_Actin_Only_8_tif.tif////
TIF image of actin plated on flat substrate. Provided by Gwendal.

////anisotropy_functions.py////
Toolbox to compute anisotropy. Perform the basic tasks related to this purpose.
Contains functions:
- rotation: rotate a vector field
- compute_angle_diagram: for anisotropy detection. Extract director as a function of azimuthal angle on a given field
- anisotropy_comparison:from an angle diagram, fit the anisotropy
- orientation: from anisotropy of defect and azimuthal angle around it, compute the corresponding director angle
- make_vfield:make a vector field of given size with a defect of given anisotropy
- crop_anf_rotate: crop a vector field region and rotate it

////chained_defect.py////
Contains the function coding for the GUI. It also binds detection parameters together to reduce them to 2.
Contains:
- defect_analyzer: from a path and initial parameters, launches the analysis with user confirmation.

////compute_anisotropy.py////
Handles the images and uses the functions from anisotropy_functions to detect and list their defects. Also contains plotting functions.
Contains:
- one_defect_anisotropy: from a field containing one defect at known position, compute its anisotropy
- get_anisotropy: from an image or a stack, compute vector field, detect defect position, orientation and anisotropy and return everything as a DataFrame.
- anisotropy_on_directory: input a directory and detection parameters.The defects positions, orientations and anisotropy are detected for each file in the directory [outdated]
- reference_profile: give the theoretical angular profile corresponding to an input anisotropy
- plot_defect_map: from defect info, plot the map with defects
- plot_profiles: plotting function. I Don't remember of what exactly
- trackmap: from defect DataFrame, plot the map of defects and their trajectory
- temporal analysis: analysis defect characteristics from defect DataFrame.
- plot_indexed_map: i Don't remember
- gauss: gaussian function
- plot_hist_movie:for each fram in the defect DataFrame,plot the histrogram at each frame and make a tif stack out of it

////detect_defects.py////
From a vector field and detection parameter, compute the charge, position and orientation of defects
Contains:
- defect_detection:do all of the above
- FindParametrizedCircle: outdated. Not used anymore.

////Example.ipy////
Example script on how to use the defect_analyzer function, with an actin image.
It is written for spyder.

////HowToUseMe.txt////
Basic hands on (?) description on how to use the defect_analyzer function.

////OrientationPy.py////
From an image, compute director field
Contains:
- orientation_analysis:does the above
- plot_field: plot the vector field on top of the provided image

////zebra_skin.tif////
TIF stack of a zebra fish embryon nostril formation. Provided by Isabelle Bonnet.
